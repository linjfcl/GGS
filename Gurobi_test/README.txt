We conducted four experiments using gurobipyï¼š
GGS_1.ipynb -- For 12 sensing nodes and a maximum of 4 hover points
GGS_2.ipynb -- For 20 sensing nodes and a maximum of 5 hover points (out of memory)
GGS_3.ipynb -- For 20 sensing nodes and a maximum of 5 hover points with time limit 10800 seconds
GGS_4.ipynb -- For 100 sensing nodes and a maximum of 30 hover points with time limit 3600 seconds

The DEVIPS and GGS running result can be shown by running the show.m
